# Objective Help

A critical tool for PHP developers is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), a package manager that enables you to benefit from open source software written by developers all over the world. To complete this objective, you will need to install it, get the full path to the installed executable, and put that path in the text field on the right.

> Note: You can validate and use composer using the full path and extension; however, most documentation will assume that after you install composer you will add it to your system PATH, which takes a few extra steps if you're using [Windows and installing manually](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#manual-installation) rather than with [the provided installer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#using-the-installer).

## Check your current versions
You can check to see your current versions (if any) with these [commands](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands):

`composer --version`

## Installing / upgrading Composer
You can find info on installing and upgrading Composer on [Linux, MacOs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos), and [Windows](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows) in the [official documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
