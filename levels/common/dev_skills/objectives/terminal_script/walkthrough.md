# Great Power === Great Responsibility

The command line interface on your computer is a powerful tool - it allows you to quickly perform tasks that affect everything on your computer. This is generally a great thing, but there are a few things you should keep in mind.

## Don't run untrusted commands or code

Because the CLI has so much power, there may be tricksters or randos on the Internet who want to fool you into using the command line to harm your computer or give away personal information. For this reason, you should **never execute code** from an untrusted source, or execute commands without understanding what they do. When in doubt, ask a more experienced computer user for help.

## There is no "undo"

When you make a mistake in a Google document, you can always use "Edit > Undo" to back out your mistake. When executing commands from the command line, there is no such thing as an "Undo". This can lead to tough situations, like accidentally losing or deleting files you still need and want on your computer.

## A timeless lesson...

When using the CLI, think before you type! Mistakes happen to all of us (even experienced programmers), but respecting the power of the CLI will help prevent you from getting into too much trouble.
