As you enter the the simulation, you see a series of floating platforms, with no visible way to walk between them. One platform holds a chest - **the flag for this area must be in there**!

You boldly stepped into the abyss, and to your surprise, you did not fall! Instead, you walked across thin air and found yourself in front of a laser barrier preventing you from reaching the next platform. Each barrier in this area is designed to test a specific programming skill.

To clear this barrier, you must demonstrate basic proficiency with a [command line interface](https://techterms.com/definition/command_line_interface), or **CLI** for short. Open the CLI app that is **already installed on your computer** - [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) on Macs and many Linux-based systems, or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7) on Windows.

Once your CLI app opens, type in a simple command.

```bash
pwd
```

Then **press "enter" on your keyboard** to execute the command. This command prints out the **present "working directory"** for your CLI (more info on this in the "Help" tab).

Paste the **last line** of the output of this command into the text field on the right. Once you have done this, click *HACK* to check your answer and remove the barrier!
