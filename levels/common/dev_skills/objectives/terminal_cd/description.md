You navigate another expanse in the VR landscape and make your way to the next laser barrier. To progress further, you must use two common commands that are used to [create and navigate folders](https://kids.kiddle.co/Folder_(computing)) from the command line.

From your command line application, use the `mkdir` command to create a new folder (also called a **directory**) that is named `quest`.

```bash
mkdir quest
```

The command above has created a new folder on your computer called `quest`! You can find it yourself in Windows Explorer or the Finder if you'd like.

Next, use the `cd` command to change your "current working directory" to the folder you just created.

```bash
cd quest
```

Next, use the `pwd` command to print out your terminal's "working directory".

```bash
pwd
```

Paste the **last line** of the output of this command into the text field on the right. Once you have done this, click *HACK* to check your answer and remove the barrier!
