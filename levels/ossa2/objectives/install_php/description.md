# Accessing Onboard Systems

After your initial encounter with Ele, the <span style="font-style:italic">OSS Elephpant</span>'s friendly guardian artificial intelligence, you attempt to move from your entry point in Utility Dock 4 to the interior of the ship. However, you discover that in order to access the ship's systems, you must first [install a PHP runtime](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) on your computer.

The <span style="font-style:italic">OSS Elephpant</span>'s systems require you to have PHP **version 7.4 or newer** installed.

When you have installed PHP on your computer, copy and paste the **full path to your PHP executable** in the text field on the right. Click the *HACK* button to validate your PHP installation and attempt a connection with the ship's systems.
